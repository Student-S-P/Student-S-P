	<p>All of the above images were used in a student project for DigiPen, showing willingness to learn tools outside my area of expertise such as Adobe Illustrator. Every game team member has to take up odd jobs and be proactive if they want to produce a good game!</p>
	<p>The name of this game project was "Refactory" - it was built on the idea that you can place blocks on a grid (including stacking them for a kind of third dimension) and that the pattern you place them down determines what kind of structure they become. They'll fuse together or split apart into turrets, walls, slowing towers, etc. I had a major role in designing the game, and the enemy/structure interactions as well as user interface were designed by me. In addition, I had to learn the C++ interface for FMOD in order to implement an audio engine for the game, and all the sounds in the game were also made by me. I did not, however, create the wonderful parts of the game engine or the graphics engine. That was done by my wonderful teammates.</p>
