	    <h2>Welcome!</h2>
	    <p>A bit about me:<br>
	    I'm <u>Seth Peterson</u>. I enjoy leading software development teams that make software which either <em>makes life more fun</em>, or <em>removes tedium from repetitive activities</em> - usually basic data collection and analysis.<br>
	    My hobbies are varied, but at the moment I am learning a lot about cooking and fermented foods. I've fallen in love with crispy sourdough crackers and ginger beer.<br>
	    I've made student games many times before, and I enjoy playing a variety of board or video games.</p>
	    <p>The links on the navigation bar above will take you to different pages where you can read more about the different things I've done with examples of my work. Here is a short list describing those different pages:</p>
	    <ul>
	      <li><strong>Audio</strong> - this page contains a few samples of audio content I've made for student projects. While it was never supposed to be my primary role on a game team, you don't meet a lot of sound-oriented people so I ended up doing all of that in addition to my programming requirements.</li>
	      <li><strong>Art</strong> - calligraphy and very basic game
		art.</li>
	      <li><strong>Projects</strong> - visit to see examples of odd job art stuff I had to do, as well as some description of the projects I've worked on (namely Refactory).</li>
	      <li><strong>Contact</strong> - This page exists to test very basic form validation, it does not actually contact anything.</li>
	    </ul>
