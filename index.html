	  <h2>Welcome!</h2>
	  <p>A bit about me:<br>
	  I'm <u>Seth Peterson</u>. I enjoy developing software that <em>makes life more fun</em>, or software that <em>removes tedium from repetitive activities</em> - usually basic data collection and analysis.<br>
	  My hobbies are varied, but at the moment I am learning a lot about cooking and fermented foods. I've fallen in love with crispy sourdough crackers, ginger beer, and fermented onion.<br>
	  I've made student games many times before, and I enjoy playing a variety of board or video games.</p>
	  <p>The links on the navigation bar above will take you to different pages where you can read more about the different things I've done, as well as pretend to have some way to contact me using the webpage. Here is a short list describing those different pages:</p>
	  <ul>
	    <li><strong>Audio</strong> - this page contains a few samples of audio content I've made for student projects. While it was never supposed to be my primary role on a game team, you don't meet a lot of sound-oriented people so I ended up doing all of that in addition to my programming requirements.</li>
	    <li><strong>Projects</strong> - this page contains examples of odd job art stuff I had to do, as well as some description of the projects I've worked on (namely Refactory).</li>
	    <li><strong>Contact</strong> - This page exists to test very basic form validation, it does not actually contact anything.</li>
	  </ul>
