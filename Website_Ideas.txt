Still need to add more music and apps, link the game project repository, AND...
...test the website's resilience to being resized, plus phone/tablet performance.

SECOND VERSION:
I want to add a webpage including my hobbies, more sound interaction on the audio webpage, more examples of student projects on the projects page, validation to the form slots which currently do nothing. I had to spend a large amount of time discovering how to make audio work and what the website permissions allowed and didn't for most users. I will add validation later on, because that functionality is less important to me as I am unlikely to enable it to send any information anywhere, while the sound interaction is vastly more important to both my identity and the user experience.

FIRST VERSION:
I've already got an existing portfolio website project from previous classes, and I would mainly look to improve it during this class.

There is a lot of wasted space, and I could add more projects that I've completed, and show more of my hobbies and personality.

A few user interaction elements could be improved - highlights when mousing over, and making the sound cue on the audio page have a visual indicator would be nice as well.

The website name will be very similar to my real name.

As for the apps, I think I will probably adapt my investment calculator to
JavaScript and add features to interact with it and have more visuals for it.
Ideally, the others should just highlight my longer lasting hobbies, such as
an app that shows how CSS can affect text and compare it to my own
calligraphy, or animations that show steps for fermenting ginger beer, with
inputs and expected results (sugar, water, ginger content, temperature, and
access to air, for example)
